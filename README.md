# Football Tournament Manager

A Java-based system for managing football tournaments, including teams, players, coaches, matches, customers, sponsors, and trophies.  
The system processes commands from a structured `input.txt` file and logs outputs to `output.txt`.

## Features

- Create and manage:
  - Teams, Players, Coaches, Sponsors, Customers
  - Match Results and Full Match Records
  - Trophy assignments (Player of the Year, Coach of the Year, etc.)
- Execute tournament queries:
  - Most active player
  - Best home team
  - Most favored team
  - Customers with highest match attendance
  - Sponsors supporting German teams
  - Entity with the most trophies
- Handles both enums and numeric inputs (e.g., skill levels and countries)

## Technologies

- Java SE 8+
- File I/O
- Object-Oriented Design
- Enums, Generics, Collections (`HashMap`, `HashSet`, etc.)

## How to Run

1. Place a file named `input.txt` in the project root. This file contains all the tournament commands.
2. Run `MainClass.java`
3. The program will generate `output.txt` with the result of all commands.

## Project Structure
- `core/`  
  Contains main domain entities such as:
  - `Player`, `Coach`, `Customer`, `Sponsor`, `Team`, `Match`, `MatchResult`, `Trophy`

- `utils/`  
  Utility classes and enums, including:
  - `Country`, `E_Levels`, `E_Position`, `Stadium`, `MyFileLogWriter`

- `init/`  
  Project entry point and logic controller:
  - `MainClass.java`, `JEuroTournament.java`

- `input.txt`  
  Text-based command file for simulation

- `output.txt`  
  Log output file generated by the system after execution

- `.gitignore`  
  Git tracking exclusions for temporary files and IDE configs

- `README.md`  
  Project documentation


## Notes

- The system is designed to be self-contained and uses no external dependencies.
- All actions and queries are logged line by line into `output.txt`
- The logic prioritizes data integrity and avoids duplicate entries.
